# Loan_Eligibility_Status
**This project involved the development of a sophisticated loan prediction model to assess the credit worthiness of loan applicants within the banking and finance sector. Applied skills such as statistics, EDA, data visualization, machine learning, optimization and cross- validation using tools such as NumPy, pandas,  matplotlib,  seaborn, and scikit-learn. Leveraging a diverse set of machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), AdaBoost (AB), gradient boosting (GB), and XGBoost (XGB), the goal was to create a robust and accurate predictive tool.**
